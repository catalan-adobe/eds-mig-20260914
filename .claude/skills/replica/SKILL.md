# stardust:replica — same-design migration

Same pages, same content, same design — new platform. `replica` migrates a
site to AEM Edge Delivery (or just re-platforms its front end) keeping the
current design **near pixel-perfect**: the target spec IS the captured current
state, the only permitted deltas are the entries of an explicit
**inconsistency register**, and every archetype must pass a **measured
source-fidelity gate** against the live site before anything ships.

Two properties make this a different animal from the redesign pipeline:

1. **No creative decisions.** The direction step is mechanical promotion of
   the captured spec — the stardust `direct` skill is never invoked. Every judgment
   call in a replica run is a *measurement-policy* call, not a taste call.
2. **Recreation, not copying.** Archetypes are authored as clean semantic
   HTML/CSS from captured content + values lifted from the source site's own
   CSS — never DOM copies, never ported page-level stylesheets. Fidelity is
   proven by instruments, not asserted by construction.

Validated end-to-end (a typographic retail home page, 2026-07-03): 8.31% → 2.93% → **1.31%**
pixel diff in 3 measured iterations, height Δ 0, content-diff "findings:
none" (198/198 nodes). Every fix came off the instruments, never off
eyeballing.

## Inputs

- `<URL>` — required. The site to migrate.
- `--breakpoints <list>` — optional. Gate breakpoints, default `1440,360`.
  Mobile is NOT free: the validation run's 1440-tuned prototype measured 24%
  at 360. Each breakpoint gets its own gate pass.
- `--register <file>` — optional. User-supplied inconsistency items to seed
  the register (see Phase 2). Without it and without an audit, the register
  is empty — a pure replica.

## Setup

1. Run the master skill's setup (`../stardust/SKILL.md` § Setup): context
   loader, state read.
2. Verify Playwright is importable from the project root (extract needs it;
   so do the gate scripts).
3. Install the gate's pixel deps in the project:
   `npm i -D playwright pixelmatch pngjs --no-save --legacy-peer-deps`.
   Same trap as diff's prereq 0: a `--no-save` install is PRUNED by any later
   real `npm i` — re-probe before every gate run
   (`node -e "import('pixelmatch').then(()=>process.exit(0))"`).
4. Copy scripts into the project and run them from there, not from the
   plugin: this skill's whole `scripts/` dir (stitch-shot, pixel-compare,
   crop-compare, chrome-parity, row-profile, sibling-variance, anchor, measure,
   gate.sh, run-capped, run-bg, gate-evidence, section, css-rules, json-query,
   html-slice, motion-observe, motion-compare) to `stardust/scripts/replica/`,
   the master skill's `../stardust/scripts/` (ledger.mjs, state.mjs — the
   ledger and state writers) to `stardust/scripts/stardust/`, the migrate
   skill's `../migrate/scripts/` (migrate.mjs — the per-page render
   driver) to `stardust/scripts/migrate/`, AND the whole
   `../diff/scripts/` dir to `stardust/scripts/diff/` (the diff scripts
   import diff-profiles.mjs, and ALL live-target hardening — including
   stitch-shot's — lives in its live-session.mjs; stitch-shot resolves it
   from `stardust/scripts/diff/` next to `stardust/scripts/replica/`, so
   keep the two dirs siblings). Never copy into the project-root
   `scripts/` — that is the EDS boilerplate's directory (master skill
   § Artifacts, the write boundary).

**Reading and inspection discipline — the context is the budget.**
Everything a step prints stays in the agent's context for the rest of the
session and is re-read on every model call. Recorded in one hands-off
session (2026-09-18, 77 minutes): 172 steps carried 750k characters of tool
output into a 535k-token context; three whole reference documents `cat`ed
at once overflowed and were then read again in full (157k characters for
text paid for twice); 21 ad-hoc `node -e` dumps of capture JSON cost 141k,
`sed -n` line ranges of a pretty-printed stylesheet 102k. The helpers below
print the part that matters, capped, and say what they left out:

- **Reference docs**: `node stardust/scripts/replica/section.mjs <doc> --list`
  for the outline, then `section.mjs <doc> '<heading>'` for the one section
  the current step needs — never the whole file.
- **Captured CSS**: `css-rules.mjs <sheet> '<selector regex>' [--media <re>]
  [--decl <re>]` — the rule blocks, each with its media condition, instead
  of line ranges of the sheet.
- **Capture JSON** (computed styles, content trees, motion checks, crawl
  logs — their shape is the run's own): `json-query.mjs <file>` for the
  shape, `--path <p> --keys` to learn an array's fields, then `--path <p>
  --match <key>=<re> --fields <a,b> --max 40` for a bounded table; values
  that feed a command (URLs, slugs, selectors) come from `--tsv` or
  `--path <record>.<field>`, never from the table — its cells are capped.
- **Captured HTML**: `html-slice.mjs <page.html> header|footer|main|.class
  [--text]` — one element, attributes stripped to the structural few,
  scripts and inline SVG removed, capped.
- **Instrument output**: never `cat` a log or a capture; gate rounds run
  through `run-bg.mjs` (Phase 4) and are read back with `wait` summaries
  and `log --grep`.
- **Live vs prototype boxes**: `measure.mjs <live-url> --against
  <prototype-url> --selectors "<css>,…" [--width 1440,360]` — rect +
  computed values per selector, one delta line per box (Phase 3); never an
  authored probe or a one-off `node -e` evaluate.
- **Images**: one crop per fact, never a full stitched page (it is
  downscaled past legibility and costs a step), never the live/build/diff
  triplet — the diff crop of the first hot band (`crop-compare.mjs`) is the
  one image a round needs. Recorded: 21 image reads in one run, most of
  them full pages or triplets, for facts the verdict lines already held.
  Step 10's eyeball of the DEPLOYED page is the published `gate.sh --full`
  round plus header/footer `crop-compare.mjs` bands (the two-band invocation
  and where each band number comes from: gate doc § Pass bar, item 5), not a
  full-page image.
  The one exception is the brand-gestalt read at extract, which uses the
  shipped `thumb.mjs` (`skills/extract/scripts/thumb.mjs`, box-filtered to
  480 px) — one image per archetype, never the raw capture.
- **Script flags**: every shipped CLI script — replica, diff, master, deploy,
  rollout, dynamics, qa, extract, reskin — answers `--help` (and `-h`) with
  its usage header before it parses anything, touches a file or opens a
  browser; the header names the flags, the exit codes and, for a script that
  writes artifacts, a `Writes:` block listing every path (the
  `script-help` lint keeps this true). The Phase 5 contract card's usage
  table (`reference/handoff-contract.md` § 4) remains the one place with the
  full invocation shape per deploy and rollout script. Never `sed`/`head`/
  `grep` a script's source to learn its flags or what it writes (16 such
  reads in one recorded session, four greps over one crawler in another):
  run it with `--help`.

Write anything you will need again to a file under `stardust/` (a lifted
value table, a section map) and read the file back by query, not the
instrument's output by scroll.

## Procedure

Five phases. Phases 1 and 5 delegate to existing skills unchanged; phases
2–4 are owned by `replica`.

### Phase 1 — EXTRACT (delegate to `$stardust extract --prep --dynamics`)

Invoke `$stardust extract <URL> --prep`, unchanged. Prep mode is required —
replica consumes the full migration inventory, not the discovery cap:

- `stardust/current/pages/<slug>.json` — per-page structure + content
  (verbatim source of every string the prototypes will carry).
- `stardust/current/assets/screenshots/` — per-page captures (ground truth
  for recreation, alongside the gate's own stitched shots).
- `stardust/current/assets/` — fonts (network-intercepted woff2), logo, media.
- `stardust/current/PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `DESIGN.json` — the descriptive
  current state (Phase 2 promotes these verbatim).
- `state.json.pages[].type` — page types (each becomes one archetype).
- `DESIGN.json.extensions.modules[]` — module candidates (become blocks).

**Bounded/single-page entry (one-page or pilot runs).** `--prep` is the
site-wide contract; it is NOT the only way in. When the ask is "replicate
just this page" — or the user wants to pilot one archetype before committing
to a full migration — invoke `$stardust extract <URL> --single` (or
`--pages <slug,...>` for a short list) instead. This is a first-class entry,
not an improvisation: the recreation phase needs, per page, the captured
page JSON (verbatim content), the per-page screenshot (ground truth), and
the captured fonts — all of which a bounded extract provides; the source-CSS
harvest and per-breakpoint computed styles come from Phase 3's CSS lifting
either way. What a bounded run skips is the prep-only inventory (page
typing, module detection), which is only needed when Phase 5 fans out to
siblings — a pilot that later grows to site scope re-runs Phase 1 with
`--prep`. **A bounded run also skips the descriptive synthesis**: crawl.mjs
alone writes `pages/<slug>.json`, screenshots, and `_crawl-log.json` — it
does NOT produce `current/PRODUCT.md` / `DESIGN.md` / `DESIGN.json`, so
Phase 2's verbatim promotion has nothing to promote. On this path Phase 2
takes the **bounded promotion branch** instead
(`reference/preserve-direction.md` § 1a): replica synthesizes a minimal
descriptive target spec from the captured page JSON + the Phase-3 CSS lift,
marked `provenance: bounded-single`.

Extract's failure modes apply as-is (bot-management headed fallback, consent
handling, no-synthesis rule). If extract had to fall back to headed Chrome,
expect the gate captures to need the same treatment.

### Phase 2 — PRESERVE DIRECTION (mechanical — never invoke the stardust `direct` skill)

Full contract: `reference/preserve-direction.md`. Summary:

1. **Promote** `stardust/current/PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `DESIGN.json`
   verbatim to the project root as the target spec. No divergence roll, no
   re-direction, no Mode A/B — the current state IS the target. **Bounded
   entry (`--single`/`--pages`): those files don't exist** — take the
   bounded promotion branch instead (`reference/preserve-direction.md`
   § 1a): synthesize a minimal descriptive spec from the captured page JSON
   + the Phase-3 CSS lift (palette, type ramp, container, buttons — exactly
   the values the lift produces anyway), provenance `bounded-single`. Never
   mix the branches: if `current/PRODUCT.md` exists, promotion is verbatim.
2. **Write `stardust/direction.md`** recording preserve mode: what was
   promoted, from where, provenance (verbatim `--prep` promotion vs
   `bounded-single` synthesis), and the register pointer. This is what
   tells downstream skills "the direction step happened".
3. **Build the inconsistency register** at
   `stardust/replica/inconsistency-register.md` — the ONLY permitted design
   deltas, the "almost" in almost-pixel-perfect. Sources: the stardust `audit` skill
   design findings (run audit only if the user wants improvement candidates)
   and/or user-supplied items (`--register`). Every entry needs captured
   evidence + the minimal change + a status. **Empty register = pure
   replica** — that is a valid and common outcome, not a failure.

4. **Dynamic surface (migration gate — the stardust `dynamics` skill Phases 1–3).**
   Phase 1 must have run `extract --dynamics`. Run the detector on the
   archetypes, draft the triage (`--target-origin` when the EDS host is
   known), curate `stardust/dynamic-features.md` + `-plan.md`. Every row
   gets a disposition; the static recreation continues regardless. This is
   what surfaces modals, players, forms, search, tags and host-bound APIs
   that pixel gates certify as correct. Contract:
   `skills/dynamics/reference/triage.md`.

Anything not in the register is out of scope for change. When a recreation
choice would "improve" something not registered, it is a fidelity bug.

### Phase 3 — RECREATE (one archetype per page type)

Full method: `reference/recreation-procedure.md`. For each page type in the
inventory, author `stardust/prototypes/<slug>-proposed.html` (+ per-page CSS)
as **clean semantic HTML/CSS** from three sources, in this order:

(a) **Captured page JSON content — verbatim.** Headings, body, CTAs+hrefs,
    alt text, metadata from `current/pages/<slug>.json`. The migrate
    content-preservation rules (`../migrate/reference/content-preservation.md`)
    apply from the first line: no rewording, no fabrication.
(b) **Exact values lifted from the source site's own CSS.** Fetch the live
    stylesheets; lift container max-widths, the type ramp, button specs,
    section paddings, radii, shadows, hero heights, the container model.
    **Fidelity values come from the original site's CSS, not the eye** — this
    converts 3–4 guess-and-screenshot loops into one. Box-by-box comparison of
    the live page against the served prototype goes through the shipped
    `measure.mjs` (`node stardust/scripts/replica/measure.mjs <live-url>
    --against <prototype-url> --selectors "<css>,…"` — rect + computed values
    per selector per width, one delta line each), never through an authored
    probe.
(c) **The captured screenshot as ground truth** for everything CSS doesn't
    name (composition, image crops, paint effects).

**Every archetype gets its own standalone prototype — cumulative, never
skipped.** Never skip to direct platform authoring for a new archetype:
prototyped archetypes stayed the quality ceiling in the field (3.5%/5.6%)
while direct-authored pages plateaued at 8–16%. Each new prototype imports
the shared layers earlier ones already gated (shared canon CSS + a
per-archetype file) and iterates only on its NEW modules — full contract:
`reference/recreation-procedure.md` § Cumulative archetype prototypes.

**This is recreation, not redesign — do NOT delegate to impeccable craft.**
Impeccable's redesign gates (critique, anti-template, divergence) do not
apply; the source-fidelity gate (Phase 4) replaces them entirely. A
"tastefully improved" section is a failing section.

**Fonts:** use the same public source when available (extract's intercepted
woff2 for open/self-hostable faces). For licensed commercial kits: never
rehost on the new domain — pick a metric-matched substitute, keep the brand
family name first in the font stack so a licensed drop-in later wins, and
surface the substitution to the user. (Prior art: an earlier airport-site migration's improvement notes, §3.7.)

**CSS-portation is the per-section fallback only** — paint-level effects not
recoverable from computed styles, JS-hydrated commerce widgets, video or
animated heroes. Port the minimal source rules for that section, scoped;
never page-level. Criteria in `reference/recreation-procedure.md` § Fallback.

### Phase 4 — SOURCE-FIDELITY GATE (the heart — measured, per breakpoint)

Full contract: `reference/source-fidelity-gate.md`. Run per archetype, per
breakpoint (default 1440 AND 360), live URL as source vs served prototype:

```bash
PROTO="http://localhost:8791/<slug>-proposed.html"   # python3 -m http.server from the prototypes dir
# ONE server, ONE port — probe before starting one (curl is always present, lsof is not):
curl -sI localhost:8791/ | head -1                       # 200/404 = something serves the port; no line = free
curl -sI localhost:8791/<slug>-proposed.html | head -1   # 200 = it serves YOUR dir: reuse it
command -v lsof >/dev/null && lsof -nP -iTCP:8791 -sTCP:LISTEN   # optional: names the pid
# Nothing answered → start yours. Answers but not your file → a foreign server: never
# kill a listener you did not start; take a per-project port and probe again.
# `lsof … || echo free` is not a probe — without lsof it prints "free" beside a live
# listener (recorded: a second server on the same port died at once and the round
# chased 404s). A stale foreign server silently poisons the gate (gate.sh asserts a
# page marker, exit 4).
LIVE="https://<site>/<path>"

# One command per round — gate.sh. The FIRST round of a breakpoint and the
# CONFIRMATION round after the last fix run `--full`: the pixel probe (stitched
# captures, NEVER fullPage:true) plus the diff skill's two probes (generic
# profile, --dismiss keeps consent + timed marketing modals out of both
# inventories) and chrome-parity, the three IN PARALLEL under deadlines, one
# verdict line each, full reports in the gate dir. Rounds in between are
# pixel rounds (no --full). Never hand-write a wrapper around the instruments:
# one recorded run did, lost the deadlines, and a round took 15 minutes.
node stardust/scripts/replica/run-bg.mjs start --name <slug>-1440-iter1 -- \
  stardust/scripts/replica/gate.sh <slug> "$LIVE" "$PROTO" 1440 iter1 --full --main "<content-root>"
node stardust/scripts/replica/run-bg.mjs start --name <slug>-360-iter1 -- \
  stardust/scripts/replica/gate.sh <slug> "$LIVE" "$PROTO" 360 iter1 --full --main "<content-root>"
node stardust/scripts/replica/run-bg.mjs wait      # verdict lines: pixel %, height delta, hot bands, structural 🔴, flags, chrome deltas

# Rounds run in the BACKGROUND and are waited for in bounded slices (gate doc § Iteration discipline,
# "a step never outlives the context cache"): start every round at once — the slots pace the Chromiums,
# no `sleep N;` staggering — then `wait` prints verdict lines only. Exit 75 = still going: run `wait`
# again as your NEXT step, never in a shell loop.
node stardust/scripts/replica/run-bg.mjs start --name <slug>-1440-iter2 -- stardust/scripts/replica/gate.sh <slug> "$LIVE" "$PROTO" 1440 iter2
node stardust/scripts/replica/run-bg.mjs start --name <slug>-360-iter2  -- stardust/scripts/replica/gate.sh <slug> "$LIVE" "$PROTO" 360  iter2
node stardust/scripts/replica/run-bg.mjs wait      # returns within 100 s; full output: run-bg.mjs log <job> --grep <re>
```

`gate.sh --help` lists the flags; `--full` exits 124 when any probe hit its
deadline (re-run, not a verdict), 2 on a pixel fail, a structural content 🔴
or a chrome delta, 1 when a probe errored (it gave no verdict — read its
`ERROR` line), 0 only when all four ran and passed.

**Pass bar (all four, per breakpoint):**
- content-diff: **0 structural 🔴** (🟡/🟠 confirmed intended);
- visual-diff: flags none or justified;
- pixel diff: **≤ 10%** full-page, with no per-500px band left unexplained
  (the band breakdown is the navigation instrument — fix the first hot band,
  top-down; everything below it is offset-contaminated);
- height delta **|Δ| ≤ 8px** (pixel-compare's own warning bar).

**Iteration discipline: hard cap 3 iterations per breakpoint.** Each
iteration's fixes come off the instruments, never off eyeballing. After 3,
log the residuals in the ledger and move on — a documented 2% residual beats
an undocumented fourth loop. **No single step waits longer than the context
cache lives:** instruments that run for minutes go through `run-bg.mjs`
(start, then `wait` in ≤ 100-second slices). One recorded 15-minute gate
batch cost a full 513k-token context rewrite — $6.30, more than the rounds
it waited for (reference doc § Iteration discipline).

**Hardening (each is a recorded false-measurement trap — see the reference
doc for the full list):** real-Chrome UA **plus the standard request
headers** on every capture (built into the shared
`diff/scripts/live-session.mjs` — the default HeadlessChrome UA gets a
Cloudflare challenge that the probes then silently measure AS the source,
and the UA alone still 403s on Akamai); a challenge/blocked interstitial
**fails loud (exit 3)**, never measured — escalate with `--headed`, and a
site that still blocks needs crawl.mjs-class capture (the gate must not
silently degrade); `domcontentloaded` on live targets, never `networkidle`;
symmetric `--main` scoping on both sides (`--main body` is never valid);
both overlay classes dismissed via `--dismiss` (consent AND timed marketing
modals); animations frozen for capture; the pointer parked after any
dismissal click (a `:hover`-styled element under the resting cursor
captures in hover state); fixed/sticky chrome replicated fixed, with its
scroll-state morph, so seam repeats stay symmetric
(`reference/recreation-procedure.md` § Fixed and sticky chrome);
granularity-parity policy for JOIN/SPLIT false-reds (#87); capture-state
policy for CDN-403 images and hydration placeholders (replicate as captured
+ log). Two defect classes only the gate catches — DOM/style capture misses
them: rendered-face font forks on inner spans (width probe) and overlay
scrims invisible to computed styles (recover by per-row luminance fitting).

The live-target hardening ships as flags on the diff scripts (`--ua`,
`--wait-until`, `--dismiss`, `--headed`, `--locale`, visual-diff `--main`)
backed by `live-session.mjs` — copy the scripts and pass flags; a project
copy carrying hand-edits is a defect
(`reference/source-fidelity-gate.md` § Script adaptations).

**After the static gate passes, interaction parity is a REQUIRED gate
output per archetype — not a post-pass**
(`reference/recreation-procedure.md` § Interaction parity; optional, it was
skipped on 5 of 7 archetypes — all shipped static). Motion is OBSERVED,
never inferred from static classes or CSS: run
`stardust/scripts/replica/motion-observe.mjs` per archetype live URL →
`stardust/replica/motion/<slug>.json`, implement ONLY behaviors that
fired (dead classes = NOT implemented), then observe the served prototype
the same way — the same `--click`/`--hover` pokes in the same order (the
comparator pairs probes by selector, then by order) — (`→
stardust/replica/motion/<slug>-build.json`) and compare:
`stardust/scripts/replica/motion-compare.mjs stardust/replica/motion/<slug>.json
stardust/replica/motion/<slug>-build.json` — one verdict line per behavior
(parity / MISSING on build / EXTRA on build / timing delta / advisory), exit
0 = parity; dead-on-live behaviors are never required, and a widget or hover
that fires on the build while the sampler saw nothing on live is advisory
(the sampler misses class-toggled and pseudo-element mechanics — confirm on
the class lines), not a fail. Record
`motion: {observed, implemented, dead[]}` in `progress.json`, and re-run
pixel-compare — the number must return to the gated value.
Widgets are implemented, not justified away. Fan-out briefs carry the
evidence rule + instrument invocation verbatim.

When all breakpoints pass, present the archetype + its gate metrics for
approval per the standard prototype approval flow (hands-off mode records
`approvedBy: "hands-off"` per `../stardust/reference/state-machine.md`).
Bookkeeping is one command each, never a hand-built JSON line or an inline
`node -e` edit of state.json (one recorded run finished gating five
archetypes and wrote their ledger lines a session later, from a throwaway
script): `node stardust/scripts/stardust/state.mjs advance <slug> --to
approved --by hands-off --prototype stardust/prototypes/<slug>-proposed.html`
and `node stardust/scripts/stardust/ledger.mjs replica source-fidelity-gate
end --detail "<per-breakpoint numbers>"`. Resuming a run starts with
`ledger.mjs tail` and `state.mjs summary --slugs`, not `cat`.

### Phase 5 — HANDOFF (delegate — migrate → deploy → rollout, unchanged)

- **Read the contract card first: `reference/handoff-contract.md`** — the
  distilled migrate/deploy/rollout rules this phase needs, the exact rollout
  ledger phase strings (`A-inventory` … `I-dashboard`), one usage line per
  deploy and rollout script, and the bookkeeping commands. Never read the
  sibling SKILL.md files whole (one recorded session read 260k characters
  of them, then re-read the overflow, before its first Phase 5 output);
  fetch a cited section with `section.mjs` only when a step needs depth.
- **Pages beyond the archetypes** go through the stardust `migrate` skill at
  **sibling tier** (`../migrate/reference/fidelity-tiers.md`): structural
  clone of the gated archetype + content-fidelity + delivery-lint +
  media-reconcile. Siblings inherit the archetype's source-fidelity gate —
  never re-author one from scratch. **Template constancy is measured, not
  assumed**: before cloning, run `stardust/scripts/replica/sibling-variance.mjs
  <archetype> <siblings…> --probe <block>=<sel> …` once per template and
  budget every delta as a block VARIANT class on the sibling's content (same
  file, § Sibling variance probe). Content-fidelity is
  **measured per page at import time** (same file, § Content-count
  acceptance) so importer bugs surface while cheap to fix.
- **Delivery** via the stardust `deploy` skill per page. Bias the decode tier toward
  **template-slotted** for fixed-composition sections (deploy #95): replica
  sections are fixed compositions matched to a live original.
  Repeat groups (cards, listings) stay reconstructive. **Blocks
  obey the Experience Workspace editability contract (deploy § 8, EW1–EW10:
  node-slotting, never value-slotting) and pass `block-roundtrip --ew`.**
- **Site-wide rollout** via the stardust `rollout` skill, unchanged — its block dedup
  is what implements "same blocks across the whole site".
- **The final gate runs against the PUBLISHED origin — not the harness**
  (`reference/source-fidelity-gate.md` § The published-origin gate): the
  delivery pipeline transforms markup, so harness numbers understate.
  Deploy the page first (`PUT → preview`), then gate it there — nothing
  pixel-shaped runs on the local EDS harness before the first PUT (that
  harness feeds `qa-gate`/`block-roundtrip` only; a recorded delivery
  session spent its whole budget iterating CSS against a harness diff and
  delivered no page). Re-run the full gate per delivered page against the
  preview/live origin,
  judged in the published-origin regime; only the published number counts.
  It is the same command: `gate.sh <slug> "$LIVE" "<preview-origin-url>"
  <width> pub1 --full --marker "<brand or domain string>"`, through
  `run-bg.mjs`. The `--marker` is required here — the identity assertion
  greps the served page for it, and the slug lives in the prototype's file
  name, not in the preview page. The evidence stays in the ordinary
  `stardust/replica/gates/<slug>-<width>/` dir under the `pub<N>` label; a
  new dir would force a fresh live capture.

**State:** replica writes its own state under `stardust/replica/` — the
inconsistency register, `progress.json` (per page type: archetype slug,
iterations used, per-breakpoint gate results, residuals, motion
inventory), `motion/<slug>.json`, and `gates/<slug>-<width>/` evidence. Pipeline status (extracted → prototyped →
approved → migrated) stays in the core `state.json` per the standard state
machine — replica never redefines it.

## What replica never does

- **No redesign.** No new palette, type, spacing, composition, motion. The
  target spec is the captured current state.
- **No content rewriting.** Captured strings are verbatim; placeholders and
  hydration states are replicated as captured, not "fixed".
- **No invented improvements.** A change without an inconsistency-register
  entry is a defect, however tasteful.
- **No DOM copying.** Never paste the live DOM or port page-level CSS as the
  prototype (that's the snowflake escape hatch, not this skill). Clean
  re-authoring is the point — byte-fidelity without re-implementation value
  defeats the migration.

# skills/replica/scripts/gate.sh — one pixel-gate round in one command
#
# Stitches both sides (live capture CACHED across iterations — hit
# minimization, source-fidelity-gate.md § Iteration discipline), runs
# pixel-compare, and prints the verdict lines that drive the loop (size /
# height delta / differing % / hot bands). The prototype/build side is
# re-captured every round; the live side only when live.png is absent —
# delete it explicitly to re-take (site changed, capture hardening changed).
#
# Usage:
#   stardust/scripts/replica/gate.sh <slug> <live-url> <build-url> <width> [iter-label]
#       [--marker <string>] [--full] [--main <selector>] [--no-dismiss] [--help]
#
#   --full   the whole Phase 4 probe set in one round: after the pixel verdict the
#            three other probes run IN PARALLEL, each under its own deadline —
#            content-diff (structural 🔴 count), visual-diff (advisory flags),
#            chrome-parity (header/footer deltas, live side cached) — and only
#            their verdict lines are printed. Evidence per probe lands next to the
#            pixel evidence: content-diff-<label>.txt, visual-diff-<label>.txt +
#            vdiff-<label>/, chrome-parity-<label>.txt. Needs the diff skill's
#            scripts at stardust/scripts/diff/ (Setup step 4). The build URL may be
#            a served prototype or the published/preview origin — the published-
#            origin gate is the same command with the preview URL (pass --marker
#            when the slug string does not occur in the served page).
#            Exit with --full: 124 on any deadline; else the pixel verdict, then 2
#            on a structural 🔴 or a chrome delta, 1 when a probe errored (it gave
#            no verdict), 0 only when all four ran and passed.
#   --main <selector>   content root for the diff probes (default: main)
#   --no-dismiss        do not dismiss consent/marketing overlays on the probes
#
# Example (iteration 2 of the home archetype at 1440):
#   stardust/scripts/replica/gate.sh home "https://<site>/" \
#     "http://localhost:8791/home-proposed.html" 1440 iter2
#
# Evidence lands in stardust/replica/gates/<slug>-<width>/
# (live.png, build.png, diff-<label>.png).
#
# Fail-loud contract: a stitch-shot bot challenge (exit 3) or capture error
# aborts the round — a missing/blocked side must never be compared. Exit
# codes: 0 gate PASS, 2 gate FAIL (over threshold), 3 bot challenge,
# 1 capture/compare error, 4 build-side identity assertion failed (the URL
# serves something that isn't this project's page — wrong/stale server),
# 124 instrument deadline exceeded (not a measurement — see below).
#
# Instrument deadlines + stale reap: every node step runs under
# run-capped.mjs (macOS has no `timeout`). Three field migrations (2026-08/09)
# recorded stitch-shot / pixel-compare sitting at 0 % CPU for 10+ minutes;
# the leftover processes from earlier rounds (and from OTHER projects on a
# shared machine — 8 found in one run) held Chromium + memory and slowed every
# later round, and agents responded with ad-hoc `sleep 150; kill` loops that
# burned a fixed 30 min per page. Before a round this script kills this
# user's replica instruments older than GATE_REAP_MIN minutes (a healthy
# capture or compare finishes in seconds to a few minutes). Overrides:
#   GATE_STITCH_TIMEOUT  seconds per stitch-shot          (default 300)
#   GATE_COMPARE_TIMEOUT seconds per pixel-compare        (default 120)
#   GATE_REAP_MIN        stale-instrument age in minutes  (default 15; 0 disables)
#   GATE_PROBE_TIMEOUT   seconds per --full probe          (default 300)

# Identity assertion — NEVER diff an unverified build URL (two field
# harvests, 2026-08: the same incident in both sessions, opposite directions —
# a stale localhost:8791 server from ANOTHER stardust project served a foreign
# site into a gate round; 73% diff misread as "prototype broke" on one, the
# foreign prototype measured as "the build" on the other. Every skill doc
# suggests the same port, so cross-project collision is guaranteed on a shared
# machine). Fetch the build side and require a page-specific marker: default
# is the <slug> (already in the served filename/URL path, so it normally
# appears in the HTML); pass --marker when the slug string genuinely doesn't
# occur in the page. KNOWN LIMIT of the slug default: when the stale server
# is ANOTHER stardust project sharing the slug (two projects both serving
# home-proposed.html), its page likely contains the slug too and false-
# passes — on shared machines pass --marker with a site-specific string
# (brand name, domain). Runs BEFORE any capture so a collision costs one
# curl, not a gate round. -L: published/preview origins redirect (https,
# trailing slash) — an unfollowed redirect must not read as a mismatch.
